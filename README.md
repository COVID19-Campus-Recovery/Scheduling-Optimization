## Purpose

This codebase was initially developed during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic at the Georgia Institue of Technology. At this time, university campuses began considering the need for physical (or ‘social’) distancing. While physical distancing is an important public health intervention
during airborne pandemics, physical distancing dramatically reduces the effective capacity of classrooms. This presented a unique problem to campus planners who hoped to deliver a meaningful amount of in-person instruction in a way that respected physical distancing. This process involved 1) assigning a mode to each offered class as either remote, residential (in-person) or hybrid, and 2) reassigning classrooms under severely reduced capacities to the non-remote classes. These decisions need to be made quickly and under several constraints and competing priorities such as restrictions on changes to the timetable of classes, trade-offs between classroom density and educational benefits of in-person vs. online instruction, and administrative preferences for course modes and classrooms reassignments.

Specifically, this package implements an hierarchnical integer program to handle the multiple criteria according to priorities. The criteria considereed are: maximizing satisfaction of mode preferences, maximizing in-person contact hours, and minimizing classroom reallocation.

For more details regarding the mathematical model, please reference [Multi-criteria Course Mode Selection and Classroom Assignment Under Sudden Space Scarcity](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2021/08/8527.pdf)

This package may be particularly valuable in the event that the Covid-19 pandemics, or future airborn pandemics, again increase the need for physical distancing, and thereby result in sudden space scarcity for universities.
